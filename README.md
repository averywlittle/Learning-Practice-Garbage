This repository is used to upload code from online classes, textbooks, and other projects I use to further my education.

Otherwise, this also contains garbage/random code that I just want to keep a record of for whatever reason.

Source List (projects/courses/textbooks from where the code was prompted):
<ul>
  <li>Harvard's CS50</li>
  <li>SICP</li>
  <li>Let's Build A Web Server @ https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part1/</li>
</ul>
